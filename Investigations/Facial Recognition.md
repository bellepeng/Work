**How does it Work**

DeepFace is underpinned by an advanced deep learning neural network. with 97.35% accuracy

It looks at a huge body of data (for example, human faces) and tries to develop a high-level abstraction (of a human face) by looking for recurring patterns (cheeks, eyebrow, etc). In this case, DeepFace consists of a bunch of neurons nine layers deep, and then a learning process that sees the creation of 120 million connections (synapses) between those neurons, based on a corpus of four million photos of faces.

Once the learning process is complete, every image that’s fed into the system passes through the synapses in a different way, producing a unique fingerprint at the bottom of the nine layers of neurons. For example, one neuron might simply ask “does the face have a heavy brow?” — if yes, one synapse is followed, if no, another route is taken. This is a very simplistic description of DeepFace and deep learning neural networks, but hopefully you get the idea.









All tools can be used for good or ill. Even a broom can be used to sweep the floor or hit someone over the head. The more powerful the tool, the greater the benefit or damage it can cause. The last few months have brought this into stark relief when it comes to computer-assisted facial recognition – the ability of a computer to recognize people’s faces from a photo or through a camera. This technology can catalog your photos, help reunite families or potentially be misused and abused by private companies and public authorities alike. Facial recognition technology raises issues that go to the heart of fundamental human rights protections like privacy and freedom of expression.

Now we can use the cloud to connect all this data and facial recognition technology with live cameras that capture images of people’s faces and seek to identify them – in more places and in real time.

__Example__

* Facebook suggestion
* iPhone unlock

* Catelog photos
* Windows computers unlock
* in the future a device like an automated teller machine.

__Potential uses__

* Unlock ATM
* Mastercard: can a selfie be good way to authenticate transactions?
* Look for a missing child?
* identify a terrorist bent on destruction
* had discussed a contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and said that Microsoft had passed a high security threshold; it included a sentence about the potential for ICE to use facial recognition.
* an app that tells a blind person who just entered the room
* Amazon made headlines last week over [supplying law enforcement agencies](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/22/amazon-is-selling-facial-recognition-technology-to-u-s-law-enforcement/) with face-scanning tech. 
* Schools in China are using facial recognition cameras to [monitor students](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/28/chinese-schools-are-testing-ai-that-grades-papers-almost-as-well-as-teachers/). 

**Potential Abuse** (1984)

* A government tracking everywhere you walked over the past month without your permission or knowledge. 
* A database of everyone who attended a political rally that constitutes the very essence of free speech.
* Imagine the stores of a shopping mall using facial recognition to share information with each other about each shelf that you browse and product you buy, without asking you first. 

**Issues**

The technologies worked more accurately for white men than for white women and were more accurate in identifying persons with lighter complexions than people of color. Some even claim that these biases are built in by design!

**Defenses!**

Concerns about encroaching AI-powered surveillance systems motivated researchers in Toronto to develop a shield against them. 

* Parham Aarabi, a professor at the University of Toronto, and Avishek Bose, a graduate student, created an algorithm that can disrupt facial recognition systems dynamically, on the fly, by applying light transformations to images.

“Personal privacy is a real issue as facial recognition becomes better and better,” Aarabi said in a statement. “This is one way in which beneficial anti-facial-recognition systems can combat that ability.”

* In a November 2016 study, researchers at Carnegie Mellon [designed](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13507542/facial-recognition-glasses-trick-impersonate-fool) spectacle frames that could trick systems into misidentifying people.
* In November 2017, experts at MIT and Kyushu University [fooled](https://gizmodo.com/japanese-researchers-trick-ai-into-thinking-3d-printed-1820077664) an algorithm into labeling a picture of a 3D-printed turtle as a rifle by altering a single pixel.



Facebook's AI lab can now recognize faces with 97.35% accuracy, but that is ~0.28% less accurate than human. That is because humans partially recognize people with smell. 

Initial attempt at FR AI tried to mimic the pattern that humans recognize faces, by dividing faces into "Face Landmarks", called Nodal points, such as eye socket depth, nose width, distance between the eyes, used to create a unique code called "Face Print".

Issue: photos have to be almost like for like, but you rarely get the same two photos of your face exactly the same. Our faces are constantly in flux, just not static.

Isuees: APIE - -aging, pose, illumination, emotions.

Solution: 

Pose: Deep Face --> 2D photo --> 3D model model, allows faces to be rotated, compare diff photos

Aging: Face print system refined to emphasize on tissues that have bones and ridges, i.e. curves of the eye socket, or nose, or chin (areas that don't alter much as we age)

Machine learning builds neural network, the larger the dataset the better it becomes, it learns and remembers mistakes and correct classifications. Facebook now has 4.4 million labeled faces. 

NameTag: takes a snap of a person, finds their online profile, might be just a slightly creepy if you're sneaking a picture of a person at a party.

Japan's national instutitute of technology created glasses with special lenses to absorb light in order to mask the wearer's features from FR

FaceIt Argus can now identify you by your skin! Tech is called Surface Texture Analysis, similar to Face Print, but creates a Skin Print. It's even able to identify identical twins, which Face Print has issues with!

For decades, FR is a fiction

China: part of Daily life! Access office buildings, take money out of ATM, meal recs from KFC! Shame J-walkers, scan crowds for persons of interests!

Deep Learinng can compensate for low light

1) Start with identifying all faces

2) for each face, measure some key metrics, i.e distance between the eyes

3) Use these measurements to compare against a template in a facial database.

More data the better the algorithm will do

When you upload, that's more data to be feed its algo. China has lots of data. 170Million surveiliance cameras installed in China. Analysts say that China plans to install 450 million new cameras by 2020. 

Makes vid searchable,  China has a casual attitude about privacy. A country that is used to governement snooping, many are willing to have their faces scanned for convenience.
